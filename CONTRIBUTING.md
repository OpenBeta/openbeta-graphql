## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [OpenBeta of Conduct](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started
### What is the API for?
  The API provides data such as climbing route description, difficulty, GPS coordinates, etc., that powers our [Climbing route wiki](https://tacos.openbeta.io).  The API is under active development so expect things to change rapidly.
 
 Steps to farmiliarize yourself with the project:

0. Browse the [Climbing route wiki](https://tacos.openbeta.io).
1.  Explore the API with an online GraphQL playground
 - Launch any online GraphQL playground. A simple one: https://graphiql-online.com
 - Enter our endpoint: https://api.openbeta.io
2. Use GitHub [issues](https://github.com/OpenBeta/openbeta-graphql/issues) to report a bug or a feature request.  Please don't file an issue just to ask a question.  Join the chat server instead.
### Ask a technical question or need help with onboarding?
Join the [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/xcWha22BhT) and chat with our volunteers.

## Ready to write some code?
We use the standard GitHub pull-request workflow.  
We ask new contributors to first fork the repo and submit pull request from your fork.  Frequent contributors are invited to join the core dev team which has Write access to this repo.  You can then clone our repo and push without having to maintain a fork.

1.  Look for issues with [`help wanted`](https://github.com/OpenBeta/openbeta-graphql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [`good first issue`](https://github.com/OpenBeta/openbeta-graphql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) labels.
2.  To work on trivial issues, simply assign the issue to yourself and start coding.
3.  To tackle a more comple issue or a new feature, we ask that you propose your changes or design before beginning the work. 
4.  As always, if you are blocked, ask for hep in the [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/xcWha22BhT).
