## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [OpenBeta of Conduct](https://github.com/OpenBeta/open-tacos/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started
1. What is the API for?
The API provides data (climbing route description, GPS coordinates, etc) that powers our [Climbing route wiki](https://tacos.openbeta.io).  The API is under active development so expect things to change rapidly.
2.  Explore the API with an online GraphQL playground
 - Launch any online GraphQL playground. A simple one: https://graphiql-online.com
 - Enter our endpoint: https://api.openbeta.io
3. Use GitHub [issues](./issues) to report a bug or a feature request
4. Ask a technical or need help with onboarding?
Join the [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/xcWha22BhT) and chat with one of our volunteers.

## Ready to write some code?
We use the standard GitHub pull-request workflow.  We ask new contributors to first fork the repo and submit pull request from your fork.  Frequent contributors are invited to join the core dev team which has repo Write access.  You can then clone our repo and push without having to fork.
1.  Look for issues with [`help wanted`](./issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted") or [`good first issue`](./issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue") labels.
2.  For trivial issues, simply assign the issue to yourself and start coding.
3.  For more complex issues or new features, we ask that you propose your changes or design before beginning the work. 
4.  As always, if you are blocked, ask for hep in the [Discord chat server](https://discord.gg/xcWha22BhT).
